Background: 

E-Cube is a web application, which allows user to book online tickets for latest movies, concertsand other LIVE events happening in the city. With the increase in web traffic, E-Cubeâ€™s websiteload time increases significantly which in turn reduces the speed and performance of thewebsite. It was earlier designed using traditional web development methodologies. Also, onadding or updating any feature, maintaining the website was difficult for the development teamdue to tight coupling of UI components. Hence, all these challenges led to unsatisfied user experience. Now they want to focus on maximizing the usability and enhancing the user experience, so the company decided to upgrade their website using React library. 

Goal: 
The goal of this project is to build an online ticket booking application for latest movies, upcoming movies, concerts and other LIVE events.
